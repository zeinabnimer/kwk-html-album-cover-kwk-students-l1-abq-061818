Pharrell isn't quite happy, he needs some help coding the album cover for his
hit song "Happy." His dev chops aren't quite as skilled as yours, so he's hired
you to take care of business.

### The Mock Up

Pharrell did provide us with a mock up of what he would like to see for the
design of the album cover:

In the industry, frontend developers are typically given specs just
like this from the product team and then asked to write the code to make a
website look just like the spec. Today, you're the developer and Pharrell is
the product team.

### SOURCE.md

Pharrell also provided us with the text for the album and all the legal
mumbo-jumbo to give credit where credit is due. You can find that text in
`SOURCE.md`. Again, this is a typical industry standard workflow, where the
developers are given copy for the site from the product team.

Each line of text in this file corresponds to a note in `index.html` that will
indicate where you'll need to add this information. It will be up to you to pick
which HTML tags to use! (Hint: Revisit `Lesson: HTML Tags` if you're not sure
which tags to use or how to write them.)

### Get To Werk

Write your code in `index.html`. Your job is to make sure the text from
`SOURCE.md` makes it into `index.html` surrounded by the appropriate HTML tags.

Keep that file open in both your text editor (to make changes to the HTML) and
the browser (to see if your changes worked). Run `httpserver` and copy the IP
address it provides to see the album cover as you build it.

Run `learn` or `rspec` to make sure you've met all the deliverables and passed
the tests.

### Top Tip

Images can be tricky. Here is a good reference for how to structure the 'img'
tag: [W3 Schools IMG](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_img.asp).  

The files you need are provided in the 'images' folder, but you'll have to write
the correct _relative paths_ in order for them to display correctly.
